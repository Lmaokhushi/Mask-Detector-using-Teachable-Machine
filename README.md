# Mask-detector-using-teachable-machine
This project has been made to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not. 
Because of the ongoing pandemic wearing masks has been a neccesity for everyone but some people do not follow these norms in public places. Hence, created this project using Teachable Machine by Google, which is a web based tool that makes creating machine learning models, fast, easy and accessible to everyone.
As a result of this project, this technology can be implemented in CCTC cameras installed in public places to monitor people whether they are wearing a mask or not
